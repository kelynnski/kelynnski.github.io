title: "Machine Learning Engineer Internship @ EdPlus at ASU"
excerpt: "I had the unique opportunity to intern with EdPlus at ASU’s Artificial Intelligence Product Department (AIPD) team, as part of both my professional development and part of the UA HLT MS program. EdPlus’s AIPD is a small unit at the university that works with cutting edge technologies, and develops various applications and tools to enhance student journeys from start to finish. During my internship, ASU announced its partnership with OpenAI, and I gained expertise in working with Python’s openai library in particular as part of this learning experience.

The internship allowed me to develop my programming skills in a practical way, where I often had to learn how to accomplish small tasks as part of the bigger project as I moved along. A challenge I faced was having no experience with LLMs or OpenAI in particular at the start of the internship, but after getting to experiment, research, and use this library to produce valuable output, I now feel extremely confident with it. I found using OpenAI’s tools in Python can accomplish many NLP related tasks that I learned about in my program, such as tokenization (their ‘tiktoken’ library offers a free way to tokenize text), information retrieval and question answering (such as setting up RAG to answer questions from specific documents), information extraction and summarization (extracting relevant information from longer texts), creating vector embeddings for text, and more. Where the LLM sometimes fell short, I was able to leverage libraries like nltk that I already had exposure to and experience with through my HLT program.

Please see the internship page for detailed information about the projects I worked on during my internship."

This is an item in your portfolio that describes your internship. It can have images or nice text. If you name the file .md, it will be parsed as markdown. If you name the file .html, it will be parsed as HTML.

As you're describing the content of your internship, be sure to describe how you were able to apply the concepts and skills you acquired from HLT courses to your internship. You'll also want to describe the things that you learned from the internship itself that might help you in future work.

## Evaluation criteria
Remember that each of the two projects in your portfolio will be evaluated on these points:

* **Length**: A summary of the project goals, technology used, and outcomes, as appropriate for a general technical audience, between 1000 and 3000 words (not counting code)
* **Content**: student’s experience demonstrates the learning outcomes for the MSHLT program [^note]
* **Code**: Code is contained in the site, or a link to the code (such as in a GitHub repository) exists on the site.
* **Professionalism**: Free of grammatical, mechanical, and stylistic issues
* **Above and beyond**: How well does this component communicate the most relevant features?

[^note]: The learning outcomes of the MSHLT program are:
    
    1. Students will demonstrate programming skills for the workplace.
    2. Students will be able to use fundamental algorithms and concepts in Natural Language Processing.
    3. Students will show knowledge of tools and packages used in Natural Language Processing.
